This repository contains code for the Alexander Gladysh's talk
on HighLoad 2016 on Rapid Prototyping of Mobile Geolocation Games with
OpenResty, Redis and Docker.

Hint: Don't forget to reset DB on the first run.

NB: The code is *intentionally* ugly. See the talk.

You may find the slides for the talk in the doc/ directory (in Russian).

The current version of the code is deployed at https://geo.logiceditor.com.
